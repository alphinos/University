# *University* :memo:

The major intent of this repository is to compile all the projects that I do (in public domain) :D
Just like a journal...

# :books: Projects I've done or I am doing:

## - [ ] **Thauxi: the starter one!** :purple_circle:
* It is a game made with Python and Pygame as the third test of the "Algoritmos I"' subject.
* It's a platformer really inspired by the game "Hollow Knight".
* I made the graphics and all the code alone...
* I wanted to make my first programming project ever to be totally mine (childish? I agree)
* Ironically, I could not share some songs and great part of the scenarios because of copyright...
* Creating things with no copyright is kinda hard, but I'll try to stay true to this idea.
* I'm really thankful for the oportunity to make this.
* The font "Gaeilge" is on public domain! I think it's pretty. Credits to father Padraig McCarthy.
* In the future, I'm gonna do a remake of this and - probably - publish it somewhere

## - [ ] **Cams Optimization: a dificulty one!** :purple_circle:
* It's a greedy optimization algorithm made in C for the second test of the "Linguagens de Programação I" subject.
* It was made in around 5 days (the test's duration was about 2 hours of the first day)
* The original problem is: you have a museum that is represented by a square matrix.
* Each row of the matrix represents a room and each column represents a connection between the row and the other room of the museum.
* Because of the starter proposition, the matrix must be symmetrical to represent the problem properly
* Basically, the algorithm picks the room with the most connections to other rooms and puts a camera on the room
* It's a problem in the same group of the traveling salesman problem and the backpack's problem
* It was really fun to do... I didn't know at the time, but I would join a research project with the professor of the subject

## - [ ] **Cofo: learning data structures!** :green_circle:
* Currently, I'm on the start of this one.
* Basically, a cofo is a bag where you can put many things.
* There will be different implementations of the "cofo" idea in C for the "Estruturas de Dados I"'s subject.
* The first implementation of this is basically an integer array.
* The second one is a generic array that stores the memory adress of the items.
* The third one is a stack (so interesting).
* The fourth is a linear queue (really simple).
* The fifth one is a circular queue.
* I'm really happy about the terminal app :D
* You can see its evolution through each cofo.
* It has functions to create the cofo, destroy it, insert something on it, remove something and find a specific element on it, and many others that depend on the structure.
* The sixth is a single linked list. It's kinda simple to use.
* With it, we have nodes and the proper list. Now we don't have a limit to its extension.
* The task was to implement something tha resolves the n-queens' problem (it was kinda fun to do).

## - [ ] **Gomes' Stationary: Object Oriented Programming** :green_circle:
* The first project that involves java for the "Linguagens de Programação II"'s subject.
* I used a lot of OOP concepts on the Thauxi project without knowing.
* Here, I am learning properly how to do the things with OOP.
* The project is composed by the product class, the store class and the seller class.
* The formatter class is just a helper to print more easily on the screen.

## - [ ] **SimpleRisc: a simple assembly** :yellow_circle:
* Simple risc is an assembly with only 21 instructions that is used in the "Arquitetura de Computadores"'s subject.
* Until now, the only "project" for the subject was to sum two numbers of 256 bits with simple risc and with c.
* The fun part was to do the sum with c, because with the simpleRisc...
* It's so simple that it's nearly impossible to do "complex" things

## - [ ] **Geometry: OOP** :yellow_circle:
* Just like the Gomes' Stationary project for the "Linguagens de Programação II"'s subject, it's an activity to practice and - actually learn - some other concepts of the OOP paradigm.
* This ones uses interfaces, abstract classes and a good amount of the basics of geometry.
* Given the simplicity of this, there are only triangles, rectangles and squares here.

As the license suggests, everything here is on public domain so you can use the code and the art at will.
Thank you :D
