# *University* :memo:

The major intent of this repository is to compile all the projects that I do (in public domain) :D

# :books: Projects I've done or I am doing:

- [ ] **Thauxi: the starter one!** :purple_circle:
* It is a game made with Python and Pygame as the third test of the "Algoritmos I"' subject.
* It's a platformer really inspired by the game "Hollow Knight".
* I made the graphics and all the code alone...
* I wanted to make my first programming project ever to be totally mine (childish? I agree)
* I'm really thankful for the oportunity to make this.
* The font "Gaeilge" is on public domain! I think it's pretty. Credits to father Padraig McCarthy.

- [ ] **Cams Optimization: a dificulty one!** :purple_circle:
* It's a greedy optimization algorithm made in C for the second test of the "Linguagens de Programação I" subject.
* It was made in around 5 days (the test's duration was about 2 hours of the first day)
* The original problem is: you have a museum that is represented by a square matrix.
* Each row of the matrix represents a room and each column represents a connection between the row and the other room of the museum.
* Because of the starter proposition, the matrix must be symmetrical to represent the problem properly
* Basically, the algorithm picks the room with the most connection to other rooms and puts a camera on the room
* It was really fun to do... I didn't know, but I would join a research project with the professor of the subject

- [ ] **Cofo: learning data structures!** :green_circle:
* Currently, I'm on the start of this one.
* Basically, a cofo is bag where you can put many thing.
* There will be different implementations of the "cofo" idea in C for the "Estruturas de Dados I"'s subject.
* The first implementation of this is basically an integer array.
* It has function to create the cofo, destroy it, insert something on it, remove something and find a specific element on it.

- [ ] **Bakery Gomes: Object Oriented Programming** :green_circle:
* The first project that involves java for the "Linguagens de Programação II"'s subject.
* I used a lot of OOP concepts on the Thauxi project without knowing.
* Here, I am learning properly how to do the things with OOP.
* The project is composed by the product class, the store class and the seller class.
* The formatter class is just a helper to print more easily on the screen.

As the license suggests, everything here is on public domain so you can use the code and the art at will.
Thank you :D
